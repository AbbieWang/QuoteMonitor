The quote monitor project is a Java GUI application that consists of two major parts. 

The first part is the real-time stock price tracker. We will select 10-20 publicly traded companies and utilize the dataset API to display their real-time data. For each company, besides the real-time stock price data, we also plan to display a diagram of changes in the stock prices for the last hour or a reasonable time interval. Additionally, for each company, we also plan to display a chart of stock returns from the given day, given month, and YTD.

The second part of our project is a portfolio gain or loss tracker interactive with users. This part utilizes data sources from part one. A user can select a portfolio based on our company list from the first part. Then once their portfolios are created, we keep track of their portfolio performance in two ways: 1) We will also have a portfolio diagram of gains and losses for the last hour or a reasonable time interval. 2) We will display a chart of gains/losses from the given day, given month, and YTD. Additionally, we would like to create a buying/selling option for the portfolio created by users. Thus, portfolio investors are allowed to switch their portfolio choices and keep track of gains and losses accordingly.

Essentailly, this quote monitor is a tool to track real-time stock prices, create portfolios, and evaluate portfolio performances.
